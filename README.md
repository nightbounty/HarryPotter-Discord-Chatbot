This is a Discord AI Chatbot that uses the Microsoft DialoGPT conversational model fine-tuned on the movie transcript of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

I trained the model using the lines of Harry Potter. He has about 1500 lines in total

## Structure of this Project

- `model_train_upload_workflow.ipyb`: Notebook to be run in Google Colab to train and upload the model to Hugging Face's Model Hub
- `discord_bot.py`: Script to be imported into a Repl.it Python Discord.py project
